The bell hadn’t given the same rushing sense of newfound freedom as it had other years, noticed Jonah with mild regret. This year, it only bestowed a feeling of meager triumph; Jonah had made it. In fact, he had done well in the new school. His grades had improved, and Jonah was proud of the fact that it had taken hard work to do so. So then why did he feel so unfulfilled?

“Hey, Jonah? You okay?” Rachel’s voice startled Jonah out of his reverie. “School’s out. We can leave now.” Since moving to Emeraldview, Rachel had become the closest of Jonah’s few friends.

“Yeah, I’m on it...” Jonah got up from his desk, arms full of unused school supplies, and headed for the hall. Rachel followed him from the classroom, footsteps unheard amid the mass of students making its way out. Turning left, Jonah passed his recently emptied locker, remembering the first time he had ever opened it. Had it been five months already?

“So, Jonah,” Rachel asked casually, “got any plans for the summer?” Jonah had to think about this for a moment or two. He turned to look at Rachel walking beside him across the school’s lawn. Her lustrous eyes were topaz in the afternoon light. Her chestnut hair shimmered in the breeze, framing her soft features in its flowing embrace. Jonah caught himself staring and quickly looked away, as he had many times in the past several months.

“I guess not,” Jonah eventually replied. Thankfully, Rachel showed no sign of having noticed his unnaturally long pause. By now they had nearly reached Rachel’s house, which was just up the street from the school. Jonah lived another two blocks down.

“Oh. Well, maybe we could hang out sometime?” With this, Rachel turned up the walk and climbed the steps to her front door. “Think about it!” she yelled over her shoulder as she stepped through the threshold.
“Of course,” mumbled Jonah, long after she had gone. “Of course.”

Waking with the rejuvenating thrill of summer, Jonah dressed and headed for the town beach. Having been one of the first places he had explored after moving to Emeraldview, Jonah regularly came down to the beach to relax. He hadn’t expected to see anyone there this early, but when he arrived, there was indeed someone sitting in the sand.

Jonah approached the figure, seeing her dark hair fluttering in the wind. In her cross legged lap, she was examining a small round stone between her fingers. “May I join you?” asked Jonah.

Rachel started, dropping the rock she was holding. “Jonah! Don’t do that to me!” She dusted the sand off the stone and stood up. She looked down at it and decided it wasn’t worth keeping, hurling it into the water. She watched it skip twice before sinking to the sandy bottom, and nodding in self-approval, she turned to face Jonah. “Wanna go get breakfast?”

Jonah followed Rachel back up the gentle incline to the main beachfront street. There were around fifteen different shops and restaurants along the length of the beach, and Rachel was leading him towards a breakfast joint called Pancake Parlour. They got a table for two beside the window looking out onto the sea. Jonah ordered a plate of waffles, and Rachel had an omelette.

Rachel explained to Jonah her plans for the summer, which mostly included a list of goals to be completed before summer’s close. Sitting across from her, Jonah slowly munched on his waffles, quietly listening.

“But before all that, I’ll be at the Beach Bonanza.” Rachel glanced up at Jonah’s questioning look. “Oh, that’s right, you’ve only just moved here. Basically, we have a big party every year after school as a sort of kickoff to the summer. You should come.”

“Hmm. I don’t know.” It really would be fun to attend, but Jonah wasn’t ordinarily one for social events.

“It’s tonight,” said Rachel. “It’ll be the time of your life – or at least the best time you’ve had since moving here.”

“Maybe.” Jonah was still hesitant on the idea. Finishing his breakfast, Jonah stood up and reached for his wallet, pulling out a twenty. Rachel looked as if she were about to object, but Jonah set the bill on the table before she could say anything. Rachel shrugged and followed him out of the restaurant and over to a bench facing the ocean.

Jonah had sat down. Rachel came to stand in front of him with the sun at her back, making it hard for Jonah to look up at her face. “Oh. I thought I’d shaken you at the restaurant.”

Rachel laughed, a beautiful laugh, one that made Jonah want to laugh along with her. Jonah smiled. He would never tire of hearing that wondrous sound. “You’ll have to try harder to lose someone so stubborn.”

Now it was Jonah’s turn to laugh. “So what now?”

“So it’s up to me, then. All right, mister, up you get. There’s a movie I want you to see.”

There was only one theatre in town, and it served for both the performing arts group and as a conventional movie theatre. Jonah hadn’t been to a movie since coming to Emeraldview, but the theatre was essentially the same as the one he had gone to before. After buying popcorn for the two of them, Rachel directed him to their seats. It was mostly empty, save for a few kids from school that Jonah didn’t know very well.

The film was part of a series that Jonah had never heard of, but Rachel seemed to be quite the fan. Whenever the main character would run into any kind of danger, she would grab Jonah’s arm – hard – until it had been resolved. She would then proceed to offer a nervous apology, but quickly had her attention recaptured by the next scene.

Jonah was really enjoying spending time with Rachel, and he actually reconsidered attending tonight’s party. The more he thought about it, the more he wanted to go. But large gatherings made him uncomfortable, and it would be nigh impossible for Jonah to bring himself to ask her to go with him. Oh well. He always had next year to work up the courage and go to. Once again, Jonah found himself staring at Rachel. This time, he didn’t look away; he was captivated by the way her face was held so intently by the glow of the movie, the way she silently moved her lips, as if to speak to the characters on screen.

The end came too quickly, thought Jonah. They exited the theatre, Jonah tenderly rubbing his arm. “So? How’d you like it?” asked Rachel.

Jonah, to be honest, hadn’t the faintest clue how the movie was. Having spent most of the duration watching Rachel, he couldn’t really formulate much of an opinion on the matter. Not that he would admit that. “It was pretty good, I guess,” he said, “but the main character was kind of annoying.”

Rachel nodded sagely. “Yeah, I don’t like him all that much either. The supporting cast is really good though, don’t you think?”

“I suppose.” Jonah was no expert on movies, and he certainly hadn’t expected to be quizzed on this one.

Rachel peered at him suspiciously, eyes narrowed. “You weren’t paying attention, were you?” The look turned into one of mock accusation as Jonah hesitated to respond.

Jonah shrugged, laughing. “I enjoyed it all the same.”

“Good. Because I have something else to show you. Come on!” There was a glint in Rachel’s eye as she said this that intrigued Jonah. What could she have planned for him? She answered his unspoken question by saying, over her shoulder as she walked ahead of him, “We’re going on a walk.” Her excitement was almost palpable, and Jonah hastened to catch up.

Jonah had gone on many walks during his time in Emeraldview. With an unknown frontier all around him, exploration had enticed Jonah. Now, however, Rachel was leading him somewhere he hadn’t gone. They were walking along the sidewalk that ran along the beach; they kept going even when it had turned gravel and found its way up a gently forested hill. “Where are we going?” wondered Jonah.

“I can’t tell you.” Rachel giggled. “That would ruin the surprise.”

As they continued up the path, the trees thinned somewhat, to the point where the pinkish sky could be seen to the west. Jonah spotted what looked to be the crest of the hill some hundred meters up the path. When they had come closer, Rachel covered his eyes with her hand. “For the surprise,” she giggled once more.

“Are you ready?” Rachel whispered, once they had reached the crest. “One. Two. Three.” On three, she removed her hand. Jonah lost his breath; he could see all of Emeraldview sprawled out before him, glittering sea beyond. The sun had nearly reached the horizon, lending shades of incandescent orange and pink to the sky. The ocean reflected the sunset in its pristine waters, extending to eternity. Jonah nearly fell to his knees.

“I love it up here,” sighed Rachel. “This has got to be the best view in the world.” Standing up there on the hill overlooking Emeraldview for what felt like hours, Jonah couldn’t help but agree. Rachel turned to him with radiant golden eyes, a grin playing at her lips. Jonah gazed back, astounded at her sunset beauty.

Rachel looked away. “I guess I should be off to the Beach Bonanza. It’s getting late.” A pang of loneliness shot through Jonah as she said this. No! Don’t leave me! he thought to himself.

She turned and walked slowly back to the path. “Wait,” pleaded Jonah. Rachel stopped and looked at him expectantly. Jonah felt his confidence crumble before him. Fighting to push the words out, Jonah muttered, “Would you… I mean, well...” Rachel tilted her head in questioning. Jonah tried once more, this time with all his will.

“Can we go together?”

Rachel’s face lit up like a freshly stoked campfire, her eyes glowing like liquid gold. “Yes! Yes, of course, yes.” Jonah felt relief wash over him as from a waterfall as she said those words. She strode back up to him and leaned in close to his face, giving Jonah a quick kiss on the cheek. “I knew you could do it,” she whispered, her voice full of gratitude. She pulled away and slipped her hand into Jonah’s.

Eagerly grasping it, Jonah gave Rachel’s hand a quick squeeze. “Off to the Bonanza?” beamed Jonah, face lit with elation.

“Lead the way.” Rachel was glowing in the sunset light, lips in the broadest smile Jonah had ever seen. They began the trek down the hill, hand in hand, Jonah barely containing his glee.

Perhaps he would have plans this summer after all.
