		<h2>This site is a work in progress.</h2>
		<p>Thanks for your interest in my project.</p>
		<p>This whole thing is being developed live, (and all by hand!) so don't expect the same site to still be up an hour from now -- or for the site to be up at all ;-)</p>
		<p>By the way, you can get free domains at <a href="http://dot.tk" target="_blank" class="link">Dot.TK</a> or <a href="https://freenom.com" target="_blank" class="link">Freenom.com</a>. I think I'll eventually make a tutorial on how to get a website like this running, and by then it'll hopefully look nicer and I'll be able to teach you better.</p>
		<p>Maybe I'll even have a ProTracker-themed store sometime, who knows?</p>
		<p>I also made this nifty Pokemon box list spreadsheet, I'll try to keep it semi-updated: <a href="box-list" target="_blank" class="link">box list</a>
		<p>While you're waiting, check out my SoundCloud playlist:</p>
