My name is Anders, and this is my website.

When I initially made the website and got it online, my immediate goal was accomplished and I had no idea what to do with my new site.

I've since realized that doing some kind of [blog](/blog) where I just write about whatever I've recently learned or found interesting would be a good thing to do with it (and my spare time)

I've also decided to do something similar to Randall Munroe's [What If?](https://what-if.xkcd.com){:target="_blank"} where you send me crazy hypothetical questions that I will then attempt to answer using science.

Email them to [ProTracker@protonmail.com](mailto:protracker@protonmail.com){:target="_blank"} or tweet them to me [@ProTrackertk](https://twitter.com/protrackertk){:target="_blank"}. I look forward to reading some truly ridiculous questions.

Maybe I'll do film/TV/book analyses and theories too...

I'm pretty excited ;-D
