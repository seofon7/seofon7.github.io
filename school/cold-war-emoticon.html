<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
<p>I will be using a scale from 1 to 4, where 1 is fully defending an ideology and 4 is fully attacking an ideology, and 2.5 is fully neutral, either due to lack of ideological motivation or counterbalancing motivations.</p>
<hr>

<h3 id="truman-doctrine-1947">Truman Doctrine 1947</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Truman Doctrine stated that the United States would provide assistance to countries where democracy was in danger of being taken over by an authoritarian power. It changed US foreign policy from one that avoided conflicts that did not affect it to one that allowed it to step in and help in distant conflicts.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 3 for somewhat attacking an ideology. From my communist perspective, it is evident that the Americans are just doing this to limit the spread of communist and/or socialist regimes, as those generally require use of force to come to power.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="marshall-plan-1948">Marshall Plan 1948</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Marshall Plan was an American policy designed to help accelerate economic recovery and rebuilding in post-WWII Western Europe. This plan had advantages for the Americans, who would benefit from increased trade with these European nations, and it would also limit the spread of communism into Western Europe.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 3 on the scale for somewhat attacking an ideology. The aid was given only to non-communist countries in Europe, though this was not originally intentional, as communist countries did not want to cooperate with the United States. Overall, this did weaken the communist position in Europe and increased tensions between the East and the West.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="creation-of-nato-1949">Creation of NATO 1949</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was created in order to provide collective security to the Western nations comprising it. Its formation was largely catalyzed by a need to respond to Soviet actions at the time, such as the instalment of a Soviet government in Czechoslovakia and the cutting off of ground access to West Berlin.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 2, for somewhat defending an ideology. This event is actually fully defending an ideology, but it is also somewhat attacking an ideology, so the two balance out at 2. NATO was a direct response to Soviet and communist advances in Europe, and greatly increased tensions between the East and the West.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="arms-race-&amp;-mad-1949">Arms Race &amp; MAD 1949</h3>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>The arms race between the United States (and NATO as a whole, to an extent) and the USSR (and the Warsaw Pact, to an extent) wasn&#39;t a single discrete event. It took place over a number of years from the end of WWII until the end of the Cold War and the signing of several treaties to limit arms in the 90s. This event involved both sides racing (with no finish line, so maybe it&#39;s not a race) to acquire more weapons than the other side to ensure victory in the event of war. Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) was the name for the idea that both sides would inevitably destroy each other if direct war ever did occur.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event (or series of events) is a 3 for somewhat attacking an ideology. Though there were some notions of defense, it&#39;s pretty obvious that the United States wouldn&#39;t be launching any of their warheads at themselves, and therefore they were all intended to be used against the USSR. The USSR responded by building up its own stash of nukes to scare the Americans from ever using theirs.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="korean-war-1950">Korean War 1950</h3>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>The Korean War was a sort of proxy war between the USSR (plus Communist China) and the United States. Communist North Korea invaded South Korea with the support of the USSR and China, and the United States sent reinforcements initially in Japan to help defend South Korea from the communist invaders.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event was a 3 for somewhat attacking. The United States was clearly attacking the communist powers by directly retaliating to the invasion. The North was simply trying to reunite the Korean Peninsula, and the United States decided that a communist Korea was a bad Korea, and so they attacked.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="creation-of-warsaw-pact-1955">Creation of Warsaw Pact 1955</h3>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>The Warsaw Pact was essentially created as an Eastern version of NATO, designed with similar principles in mind as the creation of NATO; however, it was created six years after NATO, and so was not a direct response. It was actually a direct response to West Germany joining NATO in 1955, which made the USSR uneasy. The Warsaw Pact was signed two weeks after West Germany joined NATO.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 2 for somewhat defending an ideology. It was certainly not an offensive move on the part of Eastern Europe, but it wasn&#39;t purely to defend the ideology of communism, though that was surely one aspect of it. Mostly, it was to defend Eastern Europe overall from another potential German threat.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="hungarian-uprising-1956">Hungarian Uprising 1956</h3>

<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>The Hungarian Revolution was sparked by an anti-Stalinist speech made by Soviet leader Nikita Krushchev, which encouraged the people of Hungary to be more active with their own disagreements with the government. The people saw new freedoms for criticism and debate, and made use of this new freedom to begin a revolution against the Soviets in charge of the country.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 1 for completely attacking. The Hungarians were very ungrateful for what the Soviets had done for them and were eager to rise up and attack the Soviets&#39; ideology. What ideology were the Hungarians defending? None! They were just attacking the warm blanket of communism draped over them.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="u-2-incident-1960">U-2 Incident 1960</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The U-2 Incident is named after an American reconnaissance plane (U-2 model) that was shot down over the Soviet Union in 1960. The USSR wanted an American promise not to fly in Soviet airspace, which was not made, and the USSR pulled out of a summit conference with several countries.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 3 for somewhat defending, assuming that this event is referring specifically to the shooting down of the American plane. The Soviets were trying to protect themselves and their ideology from the Americans, who were gathering information vital to potential war with that plane. The Soviets did not want to be disadvantaged in the information war.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="creation-of-berlin-wall-1961">Creation of Berlin Wall 1961</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Berlin Wall was built by East Germany starting in August of 1961. Publicly, the wall was to keep the &quot;fascist&quot; West Germans from entering East Germany and compromising the socialist state. However, the wall&#39;s primary purpose was to keep East Germans from defecting into West Germany. Tensions had been rising between the Soviets and the West over the seemingly endless stream of refugees emigrating from East Germany, and the wall mostly put an end to the worst of these tensions.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 4 for completely defending. Both the public and actual objectives for the wall were defense-related for the Soviets. Keeping the fascists out (though this wasn&#39;t really a problem anyway) kept the socialist state pure, and keeping people in made sure that East Germany and its associated communism stayed strong in terms of population and manpower.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="vietnam-war-1961">Vietnam War 1961</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Vietnam War was a conflict between the communist government of North Vietnam (plus its allies, the Viet Cong, and also the Soviet Union and Communist China) against the government of South Vietnam (and its ally, the United States). This war was a sort of proxy war between the United States and the Soviet Union, though it wasn&#39;t to begin with. (The government of the North wanted to unite Vietnam under communism, and the USSR and China saw this as being advantageous to themselves and assisted; the United States saw this as a threat and fought back)</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 3 for somewhat defending. The Soviets only got <em>really</em> involved after the Americans took it upon themselves to meddle in foreign affairs, and the Soviets were simply trying to negate the American assistance on the anti-communist side. However, this was still based around the idea of expanding a communist state, so it can&#39;t really be considered fully defensive.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="cuban-missile-crisis-1962">Cuban Missile Crisis 1962</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Cuban Missile Crisis occurred when US surveillance noticed that the USSR was providing weapons to Cuba and building missile launch sites there, in order to defend against future American intervention (such as had occurred when the USA attempted a coup in Cuba just prior, which is the main reason for the Soviets supplying weapons). The Crisis involved the usual extremely high tensions of the Cold War, (with the USA preparing an attack on Cuba and possible nuclear war with the USSR) and was resolved peacefully with the Americans promising never to invade Cuba and the Soviets dismantling the missiles.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 4 for completely defending. The Soviets had placed the weapons in Cuba in order to defend against future American invasions of the communist country, and the Americans responded the way they did because they felt the Soviet weapons presence in Cuba to be a threat against themselves. Luckily, there was never any real attack that occurred, though there were some threats of attacks.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="czechoslovakia-uprising-1968">Czechoslovakia Uprising 1968</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Czechoslovakia Uprising of 1968 (commonly called the Prague Spring) started when Alexander Dubcek became First Secretary of the Czechoslovakia Communist Party and introduced several reforms, including increased freedom of speech, in an attempt to create &quot;communism with a human face.&quot; Several months later, the USSR responded with 600 000 Warsaw Pact troops and replaced Dubcek with Gustav Husak, a much more traditional communist leader who once again imposed an authoritarian government.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 1 for completely attacking an ideology. Dubcek had sparked a potential revolution against the communist ideology of the ruling Soviets. He was blatantly rejecting the established and accepted norms of communism. If the event is focusing more on the Soviet response, it is a 4 for completely defending their ideology.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="brezhnev-doctrine-1968">Brezhnev Doctrine 1968</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Brezhnev Doctrine was essentially a response to the Prague Spring earlier that year. It was a Soviet foreign policy created by Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev that involved the USSR (and other socialist countries) intervening in countries where socialist control was threatened. The first time this doctrine was used was several weeks later, when the Soviets sent troops to Czechoslovakia to defend socialism from the revolutionaries.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 4 for completely defending an ideology. Brezhnev&#39;s goal with this policy was to defend the interests of all socialists by protecting socialism itself from external (and internal) threats.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="salt-&amp;-start-1972">SALT &amp; START 1972</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>SALT and START refer to a series of treaties between the USA and the USSR (later Russia) designed to reduce the nuclear arsenals of both powers. The first SALT (Strategic Arms Limiting Talks) agreements occurred in the early 70s, and were intended to limit future production of nuclear weapons. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan attempted to rebrand SALT as START (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks) to place emphasis on reducing existing arsenals, and this was finally pursued by the USSR in 1985 after Mikhail Gorbachev took power. The first START treaty was signed in 1991, and a second treaty in 1993. These treaties are in place to the current day.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 3 for somewhat defending an ideology. These treaties were measures to reduce the risk of MAD, though both powers were still allowed several thousand weapons each, so the efficacy of this objective is debatable at best. However, it did help to reduce tensions between the two powers and also to reduce the risk of non-nuclear war, which would have led to many ideologies coming under threat.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="soviet-invasion-of-afghanistan-1979">Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan 1979</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan refers to the event in late 1979 when the USSR sent thousands of troops into Afghanistan, which quickly gained total control of Kabul and large parts of the country. The aim was to maintain socialist power in Afghanistan as an exemplar of the Brezhnev Doctrine.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 2 for somewhat defending an ideology. The Soviets were certainly defending more than they were attacking, but the degree to which they were actually defending their ideology wasn&#39;t very large. This event could more accurately be considered an intervention in Afghanistan by the Soviets in order to secure the country as a fellow socialist country.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="solidarity-movement-in-poland-1980">Solidarity Movement in Poland 1980</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Solidarity was the first independent labour union formed in a Soviet bloc country. It was suppressed in 1981 by the Polish government, but reemerged in 1989 as the first opposition movement in the first free elections of a Soviet bloc country since the 40s. Solidarity then formed a coalition government with the United Workers&#39; Party.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 1 for completely attacking an ideology. This movement is directly rejecting the ideologies of communism and socialism. The main intents of this movement and the associated labour union were to attack socialism and instate a new governing ideology.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="iran-contra-affair-1985">Iran-Contra Affair 1985</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>The Iran-Contra Affair was an American political scandal in the 80s, where the National Security Council (NSC) of the USA was involved in secret weapons transactions with Iran. In 1985, the scandal began when the head of the NSC sold weapons to Iran under the mistaken belief that it would enable the release of American hostages. However, some of the money from this transaction was secretly funnelled to the contra insurgents in Nicaragua, a group that was opposing the Marxist Sandinista government in power at the time.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This event is a 2 for somewhat attacking an ideology. The USA was assisting the anti-Sandinista contras in overthrowing the existing socialist government. The Americans were directly supporting this right-wing group (which had gained much of its funds from the Nicaraguan cocaine trade) in its conflict with the leftists.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="perestroika-1986">Perestroika 1986</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Perestroika, which is Russian for &quot;restructuring,&quot; was a series of economic and political reforms in the USSR created by new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. He delivered a speech in May of 1985, two months after coming to power, where he publicly criticized the inefficient Soviet economic system. In 1986 he introduced the idea of perestroika, and by 1991, these reforms had culminated in the political and economic collapse of the Soviet Union, ending the Cold War.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>This series of events is a 1 for completely attacking an ideology. Gorbachev&#39;s perestroika is in direct conflict with communist ideals, and through perestroika, communism had been greatly weakened. Gorbachev was not defending any ideology, as there was no ideology other than communism. All actions taken were against communism.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
<h3 id="tiananmen-square-1989">Tiananmen Square 1989</h3>

<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
<p>Tiananmen Square refers to a series of protests led by students that called for free speech, free press, and democracy in China. The Chinese government put a stop to the demonstrations in June 4-5 1989 when military troops were authorized to fire into the crowd of protesters, killing thousands and arresting as many as ten thousand. The events at Tiananmen Square continue to be censored in China to the present day.</p>
<h4 id="emoticon">Emoticon</h4>
<p>The protests at Tiananmen Square were a 1 for completely attacking an ideology. The protesters were openly against the Communist Party government at the time and sought to remove it from power. The government&#39;s response is a 4 for completely defending the ideology of communism, as it quickly put a stop to public dissent under communism, as well as to future protests, securing the power of the Communist Party.</p><p><a href="#timeline">Top</a></p>
