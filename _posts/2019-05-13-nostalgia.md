When talking about nostalgia, we often associate it with our own memories and times past, with a yearning for what we once had. We feel nostalgic looking at old photos, revisiting to places we used to know. However, I think nostalgia can be more.

While I was writing my last-minute entry to the Collins Writing Contest, I noticed that I was feeling nostalgic -- but not for some old memories dredged up by the story. I was feeling genuinely nostalgic for the story itself.

I was somewhat puzzled by this. How could I feel the way I did about something I literally conceptualized, wrote, and edited in about three days, not to mention the fact that it's extremely shallow and cliche? (I haven't actually read it since the end of February, when I wrote it... it probably sucks, though I thought it was okay when I had written it. [Here it is](/writing/collins2019){:target="_blank"} if you wanna read it)

I notice this about other things as well, like books and TV shows, and even my dreams. Does this mean my life lacks meaning? Of course not. I hope. It just opens new universes for me to explore and inhabit.

I wonder if this is a normal human thing, or just me and my longing for something bigger. Maybe all humans are like that, always seeking to expand themselves and have new experiences.
