When talking about nostalgia, we often associate it with our own memories and times past, with a yearning for what we once had. We feel nostalgic looking at old photos, revisiting to places we used to know. However, I think nostalgia can be more.

While I was writing my last-minute entry to the Collins Writing Contest, I noticed that I was feeling nostalgic -- but not for some old memories dredged up by the story. I was feeling genuinely nostalgic for the story itself.

I was somewhat puzzled by this. How could I feel the way I did about something I literally conceptualized, wrote and edited in about three days, not to mention the fact that it's extremely shallow and cliche?

I notice this about other things as well, like books and TV shows. Does this mean my life lacks meaning? Of course not. It just opens a new universe for me to explore.
