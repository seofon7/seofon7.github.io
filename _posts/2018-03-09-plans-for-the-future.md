It's been a while.

Plans for the future? Well, I've thought that maybe I could do something like Randall Munroe's [What If?](https://what-if.xkcd.com){:target="blank"} and basically just answer strange hypothetical questions asked by readers. You can send your questions to [ProTracker@protonmail.com](mailto:protracker@protonmail.com){:target="_blank"} or tweet me [@ProTrackertk](https://twitter.com/protrackertk){:target="_blank"}.

Anyway, with school starting in a couple of days, I may not get around to updating this site all the time. (not that I've been all that active with it as it is...)

Thanks for checking this out and I'd appreciate any silly questions that you may have about anything ;-)
