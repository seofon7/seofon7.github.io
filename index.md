## This site is a work in progress.

Thanks for your interest in my project.

This whole thing is being developed live, (and all by hand!) so don't expect the same site to still be up an hour from now -- or for the site to be up at all ;-)

By the way, you can get free domains at [Dot.TK](https://dot.tk){:target="_blank"} or [Freenom.com](https://freenom.com){:target="_blank"}. I think I'll eventually make a tutorial on how to get a website like this running, and by then it'll hopefully look nicer and I'll be able to teach you better.

Maybe I'll even have a ProTracker-themed store sometime, who knows?

I also made this nifty Pokemon box list spreadsheet, I'll try to keep it semi-updated: [box list](/box-list){:target="_blank"}

While you're waiting, check out my SoundCloud playlist:
